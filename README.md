# Data Analytics Project - Analyzing the Influence of Various Factors on Global Economies

This repository was created with the intent of analyzing and delving deep into the numerous and diverse factors that affect economies of all countries globally, from quite obvious factors like Trade and the Finance Sector, to other parameters like Poverty, Gender and Urban & Social Development. Analysis of these variables on a macroeconomic scale is done in order to gain insight as to how developed and developing nations fare, and to see if minor improvements in any sector would lead to monumental change and growth overall. The dataset used for the project is the World Bank's World Development Indicators dataset, and can be found here: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/

Implemented in Python.
